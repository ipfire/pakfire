Some notes about the translation process:

The Pakfire developers cannot support various languages,
although it is very nice to have a couple of different
languages supported.

We want to achieve, that at least the major languages
in the world are included - but it is not limited to that:

	- English (done by the developers)
	- Spanish (Castillian)
	- French
	- German
	- Italian
	- Russian

Everybody is welcome to join the translation team on
transifex and add his or her own language or fix bugs
in already existing translations.
