Pakfire is the package management system of the IPFire (http://www.ipfire.org)
firewall distribution.

It is as well the buildsystem that is used to create the distribution.

Development goals have been:

 * To be very fast
   As system administration and package development is a daily job and needs
   to be done very frequently, it needs to be fast and reliable.
   Pakfire is trying to reach this goal by having a very light package format
   and a very fast dependency solver that is using the SAT algorithm
   originally developed by SuSE.

 * One error should not break the whole distribution
   Recently, if one or more packages had a build error, there was no way to
   skip that. Pakfire 3 divides the whole distribution into lots of little
   packages, which are versioned. So if one package does not build, you
   can just use the older version and do what you were doing. The error
   can be fixed later.

 * Multiple architectures and distributions
   The buildsystem should be able to work on other distributions as well, so
   the developers do not need to set up a specific development system. You
   can now use every common distribution like Fedora, install Pakfire on it
   and start with your work. Additionally, pakfire is able to build ix86
   architectures on an x64_86 machine.

 * Support multiple repositories
   Pakfire should be able to support multiple repositories. Which can be
   a testing repository, unstable, stable or a repository for development
   of a new feature.

In the end, pakfire turned out to be exactly what the IPFire developers wanted.
It is fast and easy to use, you can start development after only one minute
of installation of the software. No more waiting for the compiler to finish
compiling the whole distribution.
